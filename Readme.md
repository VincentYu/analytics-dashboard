## About

Data-informed decision making within an organization is only as good as the organization’s understanding of the data and the timeliness of that information. Faced with that challenge at the Case Foundation, the team responsible for digital analytics and reporting set out to construct a dashboard in that directly communicated key online data to the entire organization in an efficient and easy-to-use experience. This dashboard leverages multiple, more complex analytics services to provide one clear picture of the Case Foundation’s digital performance on multiple website it runs. 

Using this tool, project and program leaders can see real time performance on key communications tools like top blog authors within the organization, page views, time on page, new users, downloads, top performing pages and posts, email campaign performance. To start, we've built the dashboard to interact with our RSS feed, Google Analytics, and Mailchimp, and we plan to eventually expand the dashboard's functionality to also pull in data from other tools we use such as Simply Measured, Clicky and Woopra.
